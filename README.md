# Project College Major

We think college is an important stage of our academic career, because it builds the essential foundation of a specialized field, which can assist students in their employment and future development.

Therefore, this project aims to analyze how college majors correlate to employment by visualizing the relationships between the two. Some majors are believed to have better employment opportunities and higher earnings, and we want to explore more details about this phenomenon, as well as similarities, differences among the majors that make higher incomes.
